# zeal

A flexible text-centric [data serialization} language, designed to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data%20serialization%7D%20language%2C%20designed%20to%20be) ergonomic and editor-friendly. Modelled loosely on [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) and [TOML.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML.) zeal encodes tree-like structures as indented blocks of text, making it a sensible choice for notetaking, drafting, project planning, and similar applications.
